Each player starts with:    
    Starting Deck:
        6 Credit Sticks
        2 Small Missiles
        4 Marines

    Starting Ship Components:
        2 Structure
        1 Missile
        1 Shield

To begin the game, there is a large space stack. Draw the top 6 cards and place
them face up in the center of the table. Each player draws 5 cards. Randomly 
determine a player to go first. 

Turn:
    Draw: Draw up to 5 (you are allowed to hold onto cards from previous turns)
    Build: Put one hardware or technology from your hand into play. 
    Action: Explore, Attack, Buy/Trade
    
    Explore: 
        Look at the top two cards of the unknown stack. You may add one to your discard 
        pile, and choose a card in the market to replace (the old market card is destroyed)
     
    Trade:
        Discard an amount of gold equal to the cards cost to buy a card. They purchased card is 
        added to your discard pile. 
        
    Attack:
        Declare attack and which side of the ship.
        Starting with the defender, and alternating, do one of the following:
            - Put a resource into play from hand
            - Use the ability of a card in play (hardware or resource)

        After both players pass, resolve the combat
            - Total attack values on usable hardware and in play resources for each side
            - If the attacker wins, he destroys a ship component
            - If the defender wins, he draws a card
              
Card types:
    Resources:
        Resources are one use cards that can be played during combat, and may have abilities in 
        other phases.
        
    Hardware:
        To install hardware, you must have a slot available, either by default or with technology 
        upgrades. When you install hardware, order and position matters. A ship with missile, 2 
        structure, and a shield could look like either one of these:
        
            [M] [S] [ SHIP ] [S] [SH]      or      [S] [S] [SH] [SHIP] [M]            
            
        Hardware must be installed before use. Once installed, it stays in play until destroyed.
        
    Technology
        Technology cards unlock one additional slots for hardware. They typically don't provide
        any other bonuses. They do not exist as part of the ship, and cannot be destroyed by combat
