Each player starts with:
    Starting Deck:
        Credit Stick: 4
        Marine: 4
        Small Missile: 2
        Hull: 2

Objective: Be the first player to destroy 10 points of alien spacecraft or destroy all of
your opponents ships. If a ship has 3 or more damage points, it is destroyed


To begin the game, there is a large space stack. Draw the top 6 cards and place
them face up in the center of the table. This is the market. Each player draws
5 cards. Randomly determine a player to go first.

Turn:
    Draw: Draw up to 5 (you are allowed to hold onto cards from previous turns)
    Build: Put one hardware or technology from your hand into play.
    Action: Explore, Attack, Buy/Trade

    Explore:
        Look at the top two cards of the unknown stack. You may add one to your discard
        pile, and choose a card in the market to replace (the old market card is destroyed)

    Trade:
        Discard an amount of gold equal to the cards cost to buy a card from the market.
        The purchased card is added to your discard pile, and the market is filled face up
        with a card from the space stack.

    Attack:
        Declare who you are attacking (enemy ship in market or opponent)
        Enemy:
            Any number of times:
                - Put a resource into play from hand
                - Use the ability of a card in play (hardware or resource)

            After you pass on an action, resolve the combat
                - If the enemy wins, you destroy the outermost piece of hardware (you choose the side)
                - If the player win, add the enemy to your trophy zone.

        Opponent:
            Declare attack and which side of the ship.
            Starting with the defender, and alternating, do one of the following:
                - Put a resource into play from hand.
                - Use the ability of a card in play (hardware or resource)

            After both players pass, resolve the combat
                - Total attack values on usable hardware and in play resources for each player
                - If the attacker wins, he destroys a ship component on the attacked side. If there
                    are no components, damage the ship
                - If the defender wins, he draws a card

Card types:
    Resources:
        Resources are one use cards that can be played during combat, and may have abilities in
        other phases.

    Hardware:
        To install hardware, you must have a slot available, either by default or with technology
        upgrades. When you install hardware, order and position matters. A ship with missile, 2
        structure, and a shield could look like either one of these:

            [M] [S] [ SHIP ] [S] [SH]      or      [S] [S] [SH] [SHIP] [M]

        Hardware must be installed before use. Once installed, it stays in play until destroyed.

    Technology
        Technology cards unlock one additional slots for hardware. They typically don't provide
        any other bonuses. They do not exist as part of the ship, and cannot be destroyed by combat

    Enemy
        Enemy ships provide an alternate win condition. If a player destroy 10 points of enemy
        ships he wins the game. Enemy ships have an attack value, points value and text.

30 hardware
30 resources
20 Technology
20 Enemies
